# SC '16 Tutorial Proposal

This is a proposal to teach HPC Carpentry at Supercomputing '16,
as part of the tutorials section of the conference.
This document is developed collaboratively.
To contribute, please submit a pull request.
For discussion, please raise an issue.
Discussion on issues and reviews of existing pull requests are equally welcome!
This proposal is written based on the discussion
[here](https://github.com/swcarpentry/hpc-novice/issues/4).

# Ongoing work

Ongoing work as a follow-on from this proposal is going on in the [`hpc-novice` lesson](https://github.com/swcarpentry/hpc-novice).

# Final submission

The final document submitted to SC '16 can be viewed [here](https://github.com/swcarpentry/sc16-tutorial-proposal/blob/master/final-document.pdf).

# Proposal requirements

Please see the [call for tutorials](https://github.com/swcarpentry/hpc-novice/files/210155/sc16-tutorials-call.pdf)
for all information related to the submission.
Here is the section about the requirements:

> A successful proposal will clearly describe (in English) the tutorial topic,
> the target audience, why it is of relevance to that audience,
> and the content, schedule, and organization of the tutorial in a detailed course outline.
> The “detailed course outline” is the most critical part of the submission.
> To better understand the content and format of a submission,
> we encourage potential submitters to view a sample submission form well before the submission deadline
> by visiting http://submissions.supercomputing.org, and clicking on the “sample submission forms” link.
>
> The proposal file should contain the following sections, each beginning on a separate page:
>
> 1. [Abstract](abstract.md) - 200 words maximum
> 2. [Description](description.md) - 2 pages maximum, containing the following sections:
>   * General description of tutorial content;
>   * Targeted audience (researchers, students, developers, practitioners, etc.)
>   * Why the topic is relevant to SC16 attendees
>   * If the tutorial has a state of the practice component, a clear description of what and how those
>   parts involve state of the practice
>   * Content level (% beginner, % intermediate, % advanced);
>   * Audience prerequisites;
>   * If there are multiple presenters, how presenters will ensure presentations form a cohesive whole
>   as opposed to a sequence of disparate talks; and
>   * If your tutorial has been presented previously, a list of when and where it has been presented and
>   how it will be updated for SC16
> 3. [Detailed course outline](outline.md) - 1 page maximum
> 4. [Description of hand on demos/exercises](hands-on.md)
> 5. Curriculum vitae for each presenter (2-page maximum each). Each should include a list of tutorials/courses
> the presenter has taught.
>
> Submission of samples of visual aids is strongly recommended,
> either as an appendix to the tutorial proposal file,
> a separate file uploaded with the tutorial proposal file,
> or in the form of URLs in the main proposal file that point to materials hosted elsewhere.
> If the proposed tutorial includes hands-on demos and/or exercises,
> the proposal should include detailed evidence that the computing
> and networking resources needed for the demos/exercises will be available during the tutorial,
> and that the demos/exercises will work for attendees on those resources
> (i.e., they have been fully tested and debugged).
> SC16 will provide SCinet wireless network access to all tutorial rooms,
> and may provide wired network and power to classroom-style seating for
> “hands-on” tutorials upon request.
> (Tutorials requesting wired network and power must include a
> clear justification for the request in their proposal.)
> Demos and exercises may target common attendee laptop configurations
> (e.g., using a bootable “live cd”),
> but should provide a fallback configuration for attendees
> without access to such a laptop during the tutorial."
