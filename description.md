# Detailed description of the proposed tutorial

## General description of tutorial content

The aim of HPC Carpentry is to teach novice HPC users (defined below)
"basic lab skills for high-performance computing".
The material is designed to be covered in a full day (6 hours), and includes
    * an introduction to the command line and scripting,
    * a background in remote computing, cluster structure and batch submission, and
    * management of parallel (high-throughput and high-performance) workflows.

Designed for one site but blah blah.
Collaboratively developed feedback blah.

## Target audience

The target audience for HPC Carpentry at SC '16 may fall into two categories:

* Novice HPC users: attendees that are entering the field of high-performance computing,
but have little to no experience with the command line or remote computing.

* HPC Trainers: attendees that offer or are interested in offering
training in high-performance computing for novice HPC users.

## Tutorial goals and benefit to audience

* Provide entry-level audiences the skills necessary to begin using HPC resources effectively.
  This is the knowledge they need
  *before* they are ready to
  write MPI programs,
  or run high-throughput analyses.

* Demonstrate the "Software Carpentry" workshop layout and practices,
  and their applicability to HPC training.

## Relevance to SC '16 attendees

Unlike the "Parallel Computing 101" tutorial that has been offered
at Supercomputing for the past few years,
this tutorial is directed at outreach,
and bringing inexperienced users into the HPC community.
The scope of the workshop is intentionally limited to focus on
foundational concepts and respond to common interests of new users.

The "Best Practices for HPC Training" tutorial,
where trainers are invited to present their teaching experience,
is an excellent complementary tutorial.
Our hope is our proposed tutorial would not overlap on the schedule
to allow conference attendees to visit both tutorials.

## Content level

This is an entry-level workshop with the following
content level distribution:  
  
Beginnner: 100%  
Intermediate: 0%  
Advanced: 0%

## Audience prerequisites

This workshop assumes very few prerequesites:
  * Little to no experience with the command line or programming
  * Domain expertise or developing domain expertise (users
  know *what* they want to use HPC for, but not *how* to use it)

The audience will be expected to bring a bring a laptop computer
with wireless or wired internet for cluster SSH access.

## Lesson material and presenters

As with all Software Carpentry lessons, the material for HPC Carpentry
is developed collaboratively on [GitHub](https://github.com/swcarpentry/hpc-novice).
The presenters at SC '16 will be active contributors to the lesson material,
and to discussions about how it should be delivered.
Further, instructors are experienced teaching in teams and creating an
interactive, comfortable learning environment.
This will ensure that the workshop is presented as a cohesive whole,
rather than a series of disparate talks.
